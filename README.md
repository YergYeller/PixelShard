PixelShard V 0.00.00.1 Beta

Initiate Drop. Survive the Fracture. Ascend.

PixelShard is a fast-paced pixel roguelike where players descend into a fractured world overrun by hostile entities. Each run begins with a drop into a shifting combat zone, where survival depends on movement, precision, and decision-making under pressure.

Collect five golden shards to activate the portal and advance — but the longer you stay, the more dangerous the world becomes.

No two drops are the same.
No survival is guaranteed.

🎮 Core Gameplay Loop

Select a character

Initiate Drop

Survive waves of enemies

Collect 5 Golden Shards

Activate the portal

Advance to the next zone

Repeat — until you fall

Each area grows progressively more intense. Enemy density increases, pressure rises, and survival windows shrink. The player must balance risk and reward — stay longer for resources, or rush shards before the world escalates beyond control.

🌍 World & Tone

PixelShard takes place in a fractured digital realm — a world that has splintered into unstable combat zones. Reality is unstable. Systems are corrupted. Enemies manifest from broken fragments of the environment.

The Golden Shards are remnants of stability. Collecting them allows brief access to the next region — but something deeper may be causing the collapse.

The truth behind the fracture is still unfolding.

🔄 Replayability

Every drop is different:

Enemy spawn timing varies

Pressure scales dynamically

Player performance changes pacing

The goal is not just survival — it’s mastery.

Shard modifiers

Permanent unlock progression

Boss encounters

Multiplayer modes

🚀 Long-Term Vision

The project will continue expanding in depth, polish, and scale over time.
